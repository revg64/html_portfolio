<h3>
    Jersy
</h3>
<p>
    Jersey is an emotional heart touching movie which is serious in nature,<br/>gowtham tinnuri proved himself again after Mallirava..jersey was a complete movie with everything in it,but I felt director would have taken more depth in the way cricket was presented in the movie. Jersey passes everything & its a must watch for telugu audience.

<h3>
    The Lion King
</h3>
<p>
    My relationship with the 1994 Disney animated classic <br/> The Lion King has been rather tumultuous over the years. I knew it was a great film, but that fact was often overshadowed by its overplay in the public consciousness to the point where there didn’t seem to be anywhere in the cultural sphere that the film didn’t permeate.
